# Contributor covenant code of conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders wish to make participation in
our community a pleasant and productive experience for everyone.  We
try to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
inclusive, and healthy community.  I assume good faith, as per
[WP:AGF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith).

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for
our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Communicating respectfully with those of differing opinions,
  viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
  mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community
