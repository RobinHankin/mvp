[Code of Conduct](https://robinhankin.github.io/mvp/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to maintain a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. Various forms
of contributions are welcome:

- **Bug Reports**: Feel free to report any bugs you encounter.
- **Documentation**: Typos, clarity issues, or missing guides: your help
  is welcome here.
- **Feature Discussions/Requests**: Got an idea? Open an issue to
  discuss its potential.

Tests and checks are run on the CI, however locally one can use:
`devtools::test()`. Ideally each change should be documented. Major
changes should be `vignettes`.
