# Overview

Multivariate polynomials are intereresting and useful objects.  Here I
present the `mvp` package which hopefully improves upon previous R
functionality provided by the packages `multipol`, `mpoly`, and
`spray`.  The `mvp` package follows `mpoly` in using a symbolic,
rather than numeric, representation of a multivariate polynomial; but
it offers speed advantages over `mpoly`.  `mvp` uses the excellent
print and coercion methods of the `mpoly` package.  `mvp` includes
some pleasing substitution idiom not found elsewhere; it is
theoretically comparable in speed to the `spray` package and I present
some timings in the package vignette.

The `mvp` package uses `C++`'s STL `map` class for efficiency, which
has the downside that the order of the terms, and the order of the
symbols within each term, is undefined.  This does not matter as the
mathematical value of a multivariate polynomial is unaffected by
reordering; and the print method (taken from `mpoly`) does a good job
in producing human-readable output.


# Installation

You can install the released version of `mvp` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("mvp")  # uncomment this to install the package
library("mvp")
```

# The `mvp` package in use

Creating a multivariate polynomial is straightforward:

```{r}
X <- as.mvp("1 + a^2 + a*b*c^3")
X
```


and arithmetic operations work as expected:

```{r}
Y <- as.mvp("12*a^2  + b - c^2 + 4*d")
X+Y
X-3*Y
X^2
```

Substitution uses the `subs()` function:

```{r}
X
subs(X,a=1)
subs(X,a=1,b=2)
subs(X,a=1,b=2,c=3)
subs(X+Y,a="1+x^2",b="x+y",c=0)
```
