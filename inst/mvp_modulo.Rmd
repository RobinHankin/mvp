```{r showmvp_modulo}
mvp_modulo
```

The `mvp` package deals with the ring of polynomials with
indeterminates over the reals.  This document details how the package
deals with multivariate polynomials over a finite ring, here integers
modulo $p$, a prime number.

A short example:

```{r shortexam}
m <- rmvp(3,pow=11,symbols=3)*37
m
```

We see a standard `mvp` object.  However, we might wish to consider
this polynomial over integers modulo 7:

```{r mmodseven}
m %% 7
```

Above, the `%%` binary operator [which dispatches to `mvp_modulo()`]
alters object `m` in two ways: firstly, coefficients are expressed
modulo 7, and secondly, powers are expressed modulo 6 [on the grounds
that $(a,p)=1\implies a^{p-1}=1 (\operatorname{mod} p)$, Fermat's
theorem].  This is good for many purposes but is not ideal.  Consider:

```{r showsubsidiom}
subs(m,a=1,b=2,c=1)
subs(m%%7,a=1,b=2,c=1)
```


The answer is correct, of course:

```{r correctans}
subs(m,a=1,b=2,c=1)%%7 == subs(m%%7,a=1,b=2,c=1)%%7
```

but it would be nice for the substitution not to need manual
extraction by `%%7`.  Also, various package idiom is sub-optimal:

```{r manextract}
(m%%7)
(m%%7)*100
```

Above, the coefficients should be expressed modulo 7.  Although this
is relatively straightforward in the package, it should not be
necessary.

```{r unnecstrai}
p <- (m%%7)*100
coeffs(p) <- coeffs(p)%%7
p
```

Also

```{r toobig}
(m%%7) * (m%%7)      # coefficients too big
((m%%7) * (m%%7))%%7 # better
```

Above, note how the first product includes the term `16 a^6 b^6 c^6`
which of course is simplified to `2` on considering the result modulo
7.

## Conclusions

A proper implementation would require a lot of work.  Firstly, the `C`
code would need to be rejigged.  Currently `src/skimpy.cpp` has

```
typedef map <string, signed int> term; // A 'term' object is a map from strings to integers
typedef map <term, double> mvp;       // An 'mvp' object maps terms to doubles
typedef map <string, double> subs;   // A 'subs' object maps strings to reals
```

(`term` objects specify the powers, and `mvp` objects the
coefficients).  We would need to change `double` to `int` to work in
modular arithmetic.  We would then need to ensure that the various `C`
functions that return a `mvp` object are rewritten to work with modulo
arithmetic [either that, or do it in `R`].  If there is a pressing
need for such functionality I could be persuaded to implement it, but
this is low on my list of priorities, as of March 2022.
