To make mvp_arxiv.pdf you will need to:

1.  run R CMD Sweaave mvp_arxiv.Rnw

This creates mvp_arxiv.tex.

2. run:

latex mvp_arxiv.
bibtex mvp_arxiv.
latex mvp_arxiv.
latex mvp_arxiv.


To do this, you will need some additional files, which are not under
version control:

- arxiv.sty
- Sweave.sty
- orcid.pdf
- mvp.png [this held at man/figures in the repo]
- four_dimensional_knight.pdf [this from the spray repo at vignettes/]
- mvp.bib [this held at vignettes/ in the repo]
