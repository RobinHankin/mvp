# Single-letter symbols

Variables `a`, `b`,... `z` are given their `mvp` semantic meaning.

## Usage

``` r
data(lettersymbols)
```

## Details

Twenty-six variables a-z are defined as their `mvp` semantic equivalent:

        a <- as.mvp("a")
        ...
        z <- as.mvp("z")
      

These objects can be generated by running script `inst/symb.Rmd`, which
includes some further discussion and technical documentation and creates
file `lettersymbols.rda` which resides in the `data/` directory.

Letters `c`, `q`, and `t` might pose difficulties.

## Examples

``` r
data(lettersymbols)
(a+b)*(a-b)
#> mvp object algebraically equal to
#> a^2 - b^2

(x + y + z)^3 - 3*(x + y + z)*(x*y + x*z + y*z) + 3*x*y*z
#> mvp object algebraically equal to
#> x^3 + y^3 + z^3

```
